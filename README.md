Better Simple Reservation System
============

This is the source code of my online reservation system. The purpose is to provide a web application that allows people to manage reservations. 
The main feature that inspired the entire product was the ability to include a little HTML and JavaScript on a page which then allows for their own site to support creating reservations.

This project was my first Django project and I haven't maintained it much since giving up on the sales aspect of it. I plan on making updates to the clean up the solution as well as support some new features such as:

*  RESTful API
*  Themes for the client web site integration

Dependencies
---------

*  [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) for payments
*  [Twilio](http://www.twilio.com/) for sending SMS messages to customers reminders for rides
*  [Iron Worker](http://www.iron.io/worker) for reoccurring tasks
